Do not capitalize articles (like `the'), coordinate conjunctions (`the'), and prepositions (`of', `in') under four letters in length.
Underline the presenting author.

\section{Background, Motivation and Objective}
To introduce your topic please give a short background motivation and refer to selected relevant literature.
Take care that your contribution is in line with the suggested topic on top of the page.
Choose an adequate title that reveals the aim of your work.
Experimental details should be shown only as distinctive features to describe important information.

\section{Results}
Only original scientific results and significant findings and developments in the specific field should be presented.
Please arrange figures in a way that important information can be caught at a glance.
Sometimes, a picture says a thousand words.

\section{Pagination}
Please do not put page numbers on the paper.

    \caption{Graph of variable vs analyte concentration for two different temperatures.}\label{fig:ex1}
\end{figure}

\section{Equations}
Equations should appear in a separate line.
Please refer your equations in the text as \autoref{eq:ex1}.
\begin{equation}
    R = \frac{U}{I}\label{eq:ex1}
\end{equation}

\section{Graphics, Photographs, and Tables}
Please arrange figures in a way that important information can be caught at a glance.
Illustrations, graphs, and photographs should be centred, preferably fit in one column (see \autoref{fig:ex1}), and either be placed at the top \texttt{[t]} or at the bottom \texttt{[b]} of a column.
The resolution for photographs and graphics should not exceed 300 dpi.

The caption is placed above a table (i.e.\ \autoref{tab:ex1}) and below a figure (i.e.\ \autoref{fig:ex1}), picture, or graphic distinctive features to describe important information.
